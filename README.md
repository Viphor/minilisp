# MiniLisp

This project is only meant as an exercise for me to learn Rust.

The main features that is going to be implemented is:
- A minimal Lisp interpreter, that allows for more customization within the language.
- A library for using the language as a scripting engine within Rust projects, and maybe other C-compatible languages in the future.

Mainly this project is just about having fun.

Please share if you think someone could be interested.

## What the project is not
- I am not interested in using libraries for building the Lexer or the Parser, as this kind of defeats the purpose of trying to learn new stuff.
- It is not a project where performance is key.
- It is not intended to fulfill everyones needs.

## Thank you for your attention
